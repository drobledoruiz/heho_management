# Evaluating a breeding management strategy and population-level inbreeding avoidance for the wild population of Helmeted Honeyeater

In this repository you can find the functions and code to run simulations of a breeding management strategy and different levels of inbreeding avoidance as presented in Robledo-Ruiz et al. (_submitted_) "Testing a novel _in-situ_ breeding management strategy for a critically endangered population".

All functions require as input an MSI matrix in vertical format with each row pertaining to one male-female pair and their MSI score. The columns should be named: 
  - First column "female_band": ID of female
  - Second column "male_band": ID of male
  - Third column "MSI": MSI score of that pair
